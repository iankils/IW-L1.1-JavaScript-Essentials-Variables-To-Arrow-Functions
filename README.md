# IW-L1.1-JavaScript-Essentials-Variables-To-Arrow-Functions

# Objectives
## Students will be able to:
- Explain and use variables with both `let` and `const`
- Use `console.log()` and the developer console to determine whether code is working
- Perform arithmetic operations with variables and literals
- Write if, else if, and else to trigger conditional events including their conditional operators.
- Recognize and explain what a function is and how it is used
- Predict the expected return value of a function

## Suggested Duration
1-2 periods (45-90 minutes)

## Vocabulary
- **variable:** Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
- **declaration:** a declaration determines the name and data type of a variable or other element.
- **assignment:** to give a new value to a variable or property
- **concatenation:** the operation of joining two strings together.
- **methods:** a method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class.
- **comparison operators:** operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: > , < , >= , <= , === , and !==
- **conditional statements:** they instruct the computer on the decision to make when given some comparison.
- **arrow function:** a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.
